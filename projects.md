# Fed & Fiscal Challenge
I've led [Northeastern's teams](https://fedfiscalchallenge.sites.northeastern.edu/) for the Fed & Fiscal Challenges since 2024. Both are nationwide economic policy competitions where undergraduates present to economists. [Linked here](https://github.com/BobbySquires/NEUFed2025) is the GitHub respoitory with code I wrote for graphs in the 2025 Fed Challenge.
