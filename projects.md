# Fed Challenge
In 2024, I led [Northeastern's team](https://fedfiscalchallenge.sites.northeastern.edu/) for the Fed Challenge, a nationwide competition sponsored where undergraduates develop monetary policy proposals that mimic an FOMC meeting. The team's final presentation is [linked here](./fed_challenge_2024.pdf). The Fed Challenge was a very fun way to get experience following macroeconomic data, and I highly recommend other undergraduates compete!
