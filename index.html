    <p>
      I'm a rising senior at Northeastern University majoring in Mathematics and Economics, with a minor in Data Science.
      I'm currently looking for an economics research position beginning in summer of 2026.

      Previously, I've worked as a research assistant for Professor Matthew Ross on projects involving computer-aided dispatch (CAD) data.
      Currently I'm on co-op at Wellington Management, working on their Fixed Income Risk team. I have experience in R, Stata, and Python.
      I'm interested in projects that will allow me to apply my econometric and statistical training. I'm also an avid runner and boulderer.
