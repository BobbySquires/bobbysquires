    <p>
      I'm a rising senior at Northeastern University majoring in Mathematics & Economics.

      Previously, I've worked as a research assistant for Prof. Matthew Ross on projects involving computer-aided dispatch (CAD) data and as a co-op
      at Wellington Management on their Fixed Income Risk team. I have experience developing projects in both Python and Stata. I'm interested in research-oriented positions
      that will allow me to apply my econometric and statistical training. In my free time, I'm an avid runner and boulderer!
